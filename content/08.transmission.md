## Transmission and Susceptibility

### Mechanism of Transmission

Person-to-person viral transmission of a virus can occur through several possible mechanisms.
The primary mechanisms associated with respiratory viruses are contact, droplet, and aerosol transmission [@doi:10.1097/QCO.0000000000000563].
Contact transmission can occur through either direct contact with a contagious person or indirect contact with active viral particles on a contaminated surface [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03].
This latter mode of transmission is also called fomite transmission [@url:https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions].
Viral particles can enter the body if they then come in contact with the oral, nasal, eye, or other mucus membranes [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03].
Droplet transmission occurs when a contagious individual sneezes, coughs, or exhales and produces respiratory droplets that can contain a large number of viral particles [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03].
Contact with these droplets can occur either through direct exposure to the droplets, such as breathing in droplets produced by a sneeze, or exposure to particles that have settled on a surface [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03].
Aerosol transmission refers to much smaller particles (less than 5 micrometers) that are also produced by sneezing, coughing, or exhaling [@doi:10.1097/QCO.0000000000000563; @doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03].
The small size of these particles allows them to remain suspended over a longer period of time and potentially to be moved by air currents [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03].
Additionally, viral particles deposited on surfaces via large respiratory droplets can also later be aerosolized [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03].
Droplet and/or contact transmission are both well-accepted modes of transmission for many viruses associated with common human illness, including influenza and rhinovirus [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03]. 
The extent to which aerosol transmission contributes to the spread of respiratory viruses is less clear.
In influenza A, for example, viral particles can be detected in aerosols produced by infected individuals, but the extent to which these particles drive the spread of influenza A infection remains under debate [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03; @doi:10.1097/QCO.0000000000000563; @doi:10.3201/eid1301.061202; @doi:10.1038/s41598-019-38825-y; @doi:10.1093/femsre/fuv039].
Regardless of its role in the spread of influenza A, however, aerosol transmission likely played a role in outbreaks such as the 1918 Spanish Influenza (H1N1) and 2009 "swine flu" (pH1N1) [@doi:10.1093/femsre/fuv039].
Contact, droplet, and aerosol transmission are therefore all worth evaluating when considering possible modes of transmission for a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2.

#### Transmission of HCoV

All three of these mechanisms have been identified as contributors to the transmission of HCoV [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03], including the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-385885-6.00009-2; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
SARS transmission is thought to proceed primarily through droplet transmission, but aerosol transmission is also considered possible [@doi:10.4415/ANN_13_02_03], and fomite transmission may have also played an important role in some outbreaks [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0181558].
Similarly, the primary mechanism of MERS transmission is thought to be droplets because inter-individual transmission appears to be associated with close interpersonal contact (e.g., household or healthcare settings), but aerosolized particles of the MERS virus have been reported to persist much more robustly than influenza A under a range of environmental conditions [@doi:10.2807/1560-7917.es2013.18.38.20590; @doi:10.1186/s12985-015-0439-5].
While droplet-based and contact transmission were initially considered to be the primary modes by which SARS-CoV-2 spread [@doi:10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9], as additional information emerged, the possibility of aerosol transmission was also raised [@doi:10.1126/science.abc6197; @doi:10.1056/NEJMc2004973; @doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa939].
For example, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in air samples taken from hospitals treating COVID-19 patients led to the concern that the virus could also spread via aerosols [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2271-3].
The stability of the virus both in aerosols and on a variety of surfaces appeared similar to that of SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1056/NEJMc2004973], and fomite transmission may play a role in transmission (e.g., [@doi:10.3201/eid2606.200412]).
However, while the possibility of aerosol transmission seems plausible, the evidence suggests that droplet and contact transmission are the dominant mechanisms driving the spread of the virus [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12458], and the risk of fomite transmission under real-world conditions is likely to be substantially lower than the conditions used for experimental analyses [@doi:10/gg6br7].
These type of transmission are likely to contribute to varying extents to different types of transmission events, such as transmission within households, nosocomial transmissions, and transmission in indoor versus outdoor spaces.

#### Symptoms and Viral Spread

Other aspects of pathogenesis are also important to understanding how the virus spreads, especially the relationship between symptoms, viral shedding, and contagiousness. 
Symptoms associated with reported cases of COVID-19 range from mild to severe [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html], but some individuals who contract COVID-19 remain asymptomatic throughout the duration of the illness [@doi:10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4].
The incubation period, or time period between exposure and the onset of symptoms, has been estimated at five to eight days (4.91 and 7.54 in two different cities) [@doi:10.7554/eLife.57149; @doi:10.1164/rccm.202003-0524LE], and estimates suggest that viral shedding may begin long before the onset of symptoms (12.3 days with a 95% CI of 5.9 - 17.0) and peak around the onset of symptoms [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0869-5].
As these trends became apparent, concerns arose due to the potential for individuals who did not or did not yet show symptoms to transmit the virus [@url:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html].
Recovered individuals may also be able to transmit the virus after their symptoms cease.
Estimates of the communicable period based on twenty-four individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 prior to or without developing symptoms estimated that individuals may be contagious for one to twenty-one days, but they note that this estimate may be low [@doi:10.1007/s11427-020-1661-4].
Initially, viral nucleic acids were reported to remain at observable levels in the respiratory specimens of recovering hospitalized COVID-19 patients for a median of 20 days and with a maximum observed duration through 37 days, when data collection for the study ceased [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
As more estimates of the duration of viral shedding are released, they are beginning to converge around approximately three weeks from first positive PCR test and/or onset of symptoms (which, if present, are usually identified within three days of the initial PCR test).
For example, viral shedding was observed for up to 28 days following symptom onset in a second study [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x] and for one to 24 days from first positive PCR test with a median of 12 days [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3204].
On the other hand, almost 70% of patients were reported to still have symptoms at the time that viral shedding ceased, although all symptoms reduced in prevalence between onset and cessation of viral shedding (CVS) [@10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104577].
They also reported that the median time that elapsed between the onset of symptoms and CVS was 23 days and between first positive PCR test and CVS was 17 days [@10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104577]. 
The fact that this study reported symptom onset to predate the first positive PCR test by an average of three days, however, suggests that there may be some methodological differences between it and related studies.
An analysis of residents of a nursing home with a known SARS-CoV-2 case measured similar viral load in residents who were asymptomatic regardless of whether they later developed symptoms, and the load in the asymptomatic residents was comparable to that of residents who displayed either typical of atypical symptoms [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2008457].
Taken together, these results indicate that the presence or absence of symptoms are not reliable predictors of viral shedding or of SARS-CoV-2 status (e.g, [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.6887].
However, viral shedding is not necessarily indicative of contagiousness, and this study also concluded that the risk of spreading the infection was low after ten days from the onset of symptoms, as they determined the viral load in sputum was unlikely to pose a significant risk based on their efforts to culture samples _in vitro_ [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x].

The extent to which asymptomatic (or presymptomatic) individuals are able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 has been a question of significant interest in the first six months of the pandemic.
Early reports (February and March 2020) emerged describing transmission from presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals to close family contacts [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2565; @doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.027].
One of these reports [@doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.027] also included a description of an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but never developed symptoms.
Later analyses have sought to estimate the proportion of infections that could be traced back to a presymptomatic or asymptomatic individual.
Estimates of the proportion of individuals with asymptomatic infections have varied widely.
The proportion of asymptomatic individuals on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was the site of an early COVID-19 outbreak, was estimated at 17.9% [@doi:10.2807/1560-7917], 
In contrast, a model using the prevalence of antibodies among residents of Wuhan, China estimated a much higher of asymptomatic cases, at approximately 7 in 8, or 87.5% [@doi:10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa032/5901532].
An estimate of the population of care homes in London found that, among the residents (median age 85), the rate of asymptomatic infection was 43.8%, and among the caretakers (median age 47), the rate was 49.1% [@doi:10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100533]. 
The duration of viral shedding may also be longer in individuals with asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 compared to those who do show symptoms [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0965-6].
As a result, the potential for individuals who do not know they have COVID-19 to spread the virus is of significant concern.
In Singapore and Tianjin, two cities studied to estimate incubation period, an estimated 40-50% and 60-80% of cases respectively, were estimated to be caused by contact with an asymptomatic individuals [@doi:10.7554/eLife.57149].
An analysis of viral spread in the Italian town of Vo', which was the site of an early COVID-19 outbreak, revealed that 42.5% of cases were asymptomatic and that the rate was similar across age groups [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2488-1].
They argued that the town's lockdown was imperative for controlling the spread of COVID-19 because it isolated the asymptomatic individuals.
While more models are likely to emerge to better explore the effect of asymptomatic individuals on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, these results suggest that strategies for identifying and containing asymptomatic but contagious individuals are important for managing community spread. 

#### Estimating the Fatality Rate

Estimating the occurrence of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases is important to identifying the mortality rate associated with COVID-19.
The mortality rate of greatest interest would be the total number of fatalities as a fraction of the total number of people infected.
One metric reported is often case fatality rate (CFR), which simply compares the number of COVID-19 related deaths to the number of confirmed or suspected cases.
However, in locations without universal testing protocols, it is impossible to identify all exposed or all infected individuals because so many asymptomatic or mild cases go undetected.
Therefore, a more informative metric is the infection fatality rate (IFR), which compares the known deaths to the estimated number of cases.
Meta-analyses have produced estimates of global IFR ranging from as low as 0.1% to as high as 1.04% [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854; @url:https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/; @doi:10.1101/2020.05.11.20098780; @doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854].
All of these estimates note that IFR varies widely around the world.
Estimates of infection rates are becoming more feasible as more data becomes available for modeling and will be bolstered as serological testing becomes more common and available.

### Dynamics of Transmission

Disease spread dynamics can be estimated using R~0~, the basic reproduction number, and R~t~, the effective reproduction number.
Thus, accurate estimates are crucial to understanding the dynamics of infection and to predict the effects of different interventions.
R~0~ and the timescale of infection (measured by the infectious period and the exposed period) govern population-level epidemic dynamics, with R~0~ being one of the most important epidemiological parameters [@isbn:9780691116174].
R~0~ is the average number of new (secondary) infections caused by one infected person, assuming a wholly susceptible population [@doi:10.1111/j.1467-9574.1996.tb01482.x].
A simple mechanistic model used to describe infectious disease dynamics is a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model.
In this formulation individuals move through three states: susceptible, infected, and recovered; two parameters, $\gamma$ and $\beta$, specify the rate at which the infectious recover, and the infection transmission rate, respectively.
In this simple formulation, R~0~ is estimated as the ratio of $\beta$ and $\gamma$.[@doi:10.1126/science.abb5659; @isbn:9780691116174].
A pathogen can invade a susceptible population only if R~0~ > 1 [@isbn:9780691116174; @isbn:9780199209996].
The spread of an infectious disease at a particular time t can be quantified by R~t~, the effective reproduction number, which assumes that part of the population has already recovered (and thus gained immunity to reinfection) or that mitigating interventions were put into place.
For example, if only a fraction S~t~ of the population is still susceptible, R~t~ = S~t~ x R~0~.
When R~t~ is greater than 1, an epidemic grows (i.e., the proportion of the population that is infectious increases); when R~t~ is less than 1, the proportion of the population that is infectious decreases.
R~0~ and R~t~ can be estimated directly from epidemiological data or inferred using mathematical modeling.
Modeling approaches are typically based upon a classic epidemiological model structure: the SIR model and its extensions [@https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118; @doi:10.1038/280361a0].
In the context of SARS-CoV-2, more complex modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models are commonly used.[need citations]

Estimates of R~0~ for COVID-19 lie in the range R~0~=1.4-6.5 [@doi:10/ggjvr7; @doi:10.1093/jtm/taaa021; @doi:10.1126/science.abb3221].
Variation in R~0~ is expected between different populations and the estimated values of R~0~ discussed below are for specific populations in specific environments.
The different estimates of R~0~ should not necessarily be interpreted as a range of estimates of the same underlying parameter.

<!--I am not quite sure about this next paragraph. Most sophisticated models now incorporate "data" in their SEIR formulation, so I'm not sure it's accurate to draw the distinction.-->

In one study of international cases, the predicted value is R~0~=1.7 [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.21.20040329], in China (both Hubei province and nationwide), the value is predicted to lie in the range R~0~=2.0-3.6 [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3524675; @doi:10.1101/2020.01.25.919787; @doi:10/ggjvr7], and on a cruise ship where an outbreak occurred, predicted R~0~=2.28 [@doi:10.1016/j.ijid.2020.02.033].
SEIR model-derived estimates of R~0~ range from 2.0 - 6.5 in China [@doi:10.3390/jcm9020462; @doi:10.1101/2020.01.27.20018952; @doi:10.1101/2020.01.23.916726; @doi:10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549] to R~0~=4.8 in France [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.22.20040915].
Using the same model as for the French population, a study estimated R~0~=2.6 in South Korea [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.22.20040915], which is consistent with other studies [@tag:Park2020_distancing].
From a meta-analysis of studies estimating R~0~, [@doi:10.1093/jtm/taaa021] predict the median as R~0~=2.79.

Inference of the effective reproduction number can provide insight into how populations respond to an infection, and the effectiveness of interventions.
In China, R~t~ was predicted to lie in the range 1.6-2.6 in Jan 2020, before travel restrictions [@doi:10/ggptcf].
R~t~ decreased from 2.35 one week before travel restrictions were imposed (Jan 23, 2020), to 1.05 one week after.
Using their model, the authors also estimate the probability of new outbreaks occurring: the probability of a single individual exporting virus causing a large outbreak is 17-25% assuming MERS-like or SARS-like transmission, and the probability of a large outbreak occurring after ≥4 infections exist at a new location is greater than 50%.
An independent study came to similar conclusions: in a two-week period before Jan 23 finding R~t~=2.38, and decreasing to R~t~ = 1.34 (using data from Jan 24 to Feb 3) or R~t~=0.98 (using data from Jan 24 to Feb 8) [@doi:10.1126/science.abb3221].
In South Korea, R~t~ was inferred for Feb-Mar 2020 in two cities: Daegu (the center of the outbreak), and Seoul [@tag:Park2020_distancing].
Metro data was also analyzed to estimate the effects of social distancing measures.
R~t~ decreased in Daegu from around 3 to <1 over the period that social distancing measures were introduced.
In Seoul, R~t~ decreased slightly, but remained close to 1 (and larger than R~t~ in Daegu).
This highlights that social distancing measures appeared to work to contain the infection in Daegu, but that in Seoul, R~t~ remains above 1, thus secondary outbreaks are possible.
It also shows the importance of region-specific analysis: the large decline in case load nationwide is mainly due to the Daegu region, and could hide persistence of the epidemic in other regions, such as Seoul and Gyeonggi-do.
In Iran, estimates of R~t~ declined from 4.86 in the first week to 2.1 by the fourth week after the first cases were reported [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.20.20038422].
In Europe, analysis of 11 countries inferred the dynamics of R~t~ over a time range from the beginning of the outbreak until March 28, 2020, by which point most countries had implemented major interventions (such as school closures, public gathering bans, and stay-at-home orders) [@doi:10.25561/77731].
Across all countries, the mean R~t~ before interventions began was estimated as 3.87; R~t~ varied considerably, from below 3 in Norway to above 4.5 in Spain.
After interventions, R~t~ decreased by an average of 64% across all countries, with mean R~t~=1.43.
The lowest predicted value was 0.97 for Norway and the highest was 2.64 for Sweden, which may be in part because Sweden did not implement social distancing measures on the same scale as other countries.
The study concludes that while large changes in R~t~ are observed, it is too early to tell whether the interventions put into place are sufficient to decrease R~t~ below 1.

More generally, population-level epidemic dynamics can be both observed and modelled [@doi:10.1126/science.abb5659].
Data and empirically determined biological mechanisms inform models, while models can be used to try to understand data and systems of interest or to make predictions about possible future dynamics, such as the estimation of capacity needs [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2004064117] or the comparison of predicted outcomes among prevention and control strategies [@doi:10/ggp3xq; @doi:10.1073/pnas.2004978117].
Many current efforts to model R~t~ have led to tools that assist the visualization of estimates in real time or over recent intervals [@url:https://epiforecasts.io/covid; @url:https://rt.live].
While these may be valuable resources, it is important to note that the estimates arise from models containing many assumptions and are dependent on the quality of the data they use, which varies widely by region.

### Molecular Signatures and Transmission

Genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2 has been used to elucidate patterns over time and space.
Numerous mutations [@doi:10.1186/s12967-020-02344-6; @doi:10.1093/nsr/nwaa036; @doi:10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104351] observed in individual SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to trace transmission patterns and have provided insight during outbreak investigations. <!--move citations to later in sentence?-->
Similar mutations observed in several patients may indicate that the patients belong to the same transmission group.
The tracking of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is recognized as an essential tool for controlling outbreaks that may provide valuable insights into the paths of SARS-CoV-2's spread [@doi:10/d5mg].
Several studies used phylogenetic analysis to determine the source of local COVID-19 outbreaks in Connecticut (USA), [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.021], the New York City area (USA) [@doi:10.1126/science.abc1917], and Iceland [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2006100].
There is an ongoing effort to collect SARS-CoV-2 genomes throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, and as of August 7, 2020, more than 78,000 genome sequences have been collected from patients. <!-- TODO: consider auto-updating this -->
The sequencing data can be found at GISAID [@https://www.gisaid.org/], NCBI [@https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/], and COVID-19 data portal [@https://www.covid19dataportal.org/].

### Factors Influencing Susceptibility

As COVID-19 has spread into communities around the globe, it has become clear that the risks associated with this disease are not equally shared by all individuals or all communities.
Significant disparities in outcomes have led to interest in the demographic, biomedical, and social factors that influence COVID-19 severity.
Untangling the factors influencing COVID-19 susceptibility is a complex undertaking.
Among patients who are admitted to the hospital, outcomes have generally been poor, with rates of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) upwards of 15% in both Wuhan, China and Italy [@doi:10.1056/nejmoa2002032; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.2648; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4031].
However, hospitalization rates vary by location [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3].
This variation may be influenced by demographic (e.g., average age in the area), medical (e.g., the prevalence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes), and social (e.g., income or healthcare availability) factors that vary geographically.
Additionally, some of the same factors may influence an individual's probability of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, their risk of developing a more serious case of COVID-19 that would require hospitalization, and their access to medical support.
As a result, quantifying or comparing susceptibility among individuals, communities, or other groups requires consideration of a number of complex phenomena that intersect across many disciplines of research.
In this section, the term "risk factors" is used to refer to variables that are statistically associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Some are intrinsic characteristics that have been observed to carry an association with variation in outcomes, whereas others may be more functionally linked to the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

#### Patient Traits Associated with Increased Risk

Two traits that have been consistently associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes are male sex and advanced age.
In the United States, males and older individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were found to be more likely to require hospitalization [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598; @doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1].
A retrospective study of hospitalized Chinese patients [@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age, and world-wide, population age structure has been found to be an important variable for explaining differences in outbreak severity [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2004911117].
The CFR for adults over 80 has been estimated upwards of 14% or even 20% [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16472].
Male sex has also been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, including death [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m1985; @doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9; @url:https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/].
Early reports from China and Europe indicated that even though the case rates were similar across males and females, males were at elevated risk for hospital admission, ICU admission, and death [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9], although data from some US states indicates more cases among females, potentially due to gender representation in care-taking professions [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
In older age groups (e.g., age 60 and older), comparable absolute numbers of male and female cases actually suggests a higher rate of occurrence in males, due to increased skew in the sex ratio [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9].
Current estimates based on worldwide data suggest that, compared to females, males may be 30% more likely to be hospitalized, 80% more likely to be admitted to the ICU, and 40% more likely to die as a result of COVID-19 [@url:https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/].
There also may be a compounding effect of advanced age and male sex, with differences time to recovery worst for males over 60 years old relative to female members of their age cohort [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008520].

Both of these risk factors can be approached through the lens of biology.
The biological basis for greater susceptibility with age is likely linked to the prevalence of extenuating health conditions such as heart failure or diabetes [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16472].
Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for differences in severity between males and females.
For example, some evidence suggests that female sex hormones may be protective [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9; @doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
ACE2 expression in the kidneys of male mice was observed to be twice as high as that of females, and a regulatory effect of estradiol on ACE2 expression was demonstrated by removing the gonads and then supplementing with estradiol [@doi:10.1186/2042-6410-1-6; @doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
Other work in mice has shown an inverse association between mortality due to SARS-CoV and estradiol, suggesting a protective role for the sex hormone [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
Similarly, evidence suggests that similar patterns might be found in other tissues: preliminary analysis suggested that male patients with aortic valve stenosis may show higher levels of ACE2 expression in the myocardium than females, although this pattern was not found in controls, and research has indicated that females may respond to lower doses of heart medications that act on a pathway shared with ACE2 (Renin angiotensin aldosterone system or RAAS) [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9].
Additionally, several components of the immune response, including the inflammatory response, may differ in intensity and timing between males and females [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570; @doi:10.1186/2042-6410-1-6].
This hypothesis is supported by some preliminary evidence showing that female patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 had higher antibody titers than males [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
Sex steroids can also bind to immune cell receptors to influence cytokine production [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9].
Additionally, social factors may influence risks related to both age and sex: for example, older adults are more likely to live in care facilities, which have been a source for a large number of outbreaks [@doi:10.1093/qjmed/hcaa136], and gender roles may also influence exposure and/or susceptibility due to differences in care-taking and/or risky behaviors (e.g., caring for elder relatives and smoking, respectively) [@doi:10.1186/s13293-020-00304-9] among men and women (however, it should be noted that both transgender men and women are suspected to be at heightened risk [@url:https://escholarship.org/uc/item/55t297mc].)

#### Comorbid Health Conditions

A number of pre-existing or comorbid conditions have repeatedly been identified as risk factors for more severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Several underlying health conditions were identified at high prevalence among hospitalized patients, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, and cardiovascular disease [@doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e3].
Higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores have been associated with a higher probability of mortality [@doi:10/ggnxb3], and comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular and lung disease as well as obesity were also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death, even when correcting for age and sex [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m1985].
Diabetes may increase the risk of lengthy hospitalization [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021] or of death [@doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021;@doi:10.1007/s00592-020-01546-0].
[@doi:10.1111/dom.14057] and [@doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00124.2020] discuss possible ways in which COVID-19 and diabetes may interact.
Obesity also appears to be associated with higher risk of severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154262; @doi:10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042].
Obesity is considered an underlying risk factor for other health problems, and the mechanism for its contributions to COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality is not yet clear [@doi:10.1016/j.medj.2020.06.005].
Dementia and cancer were also associated with the risk of death in an analysis of a large number (more than 20,000) COVID-19 patients in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1136/bmj.m1985].
It should be noted that comorbid conditions are inextricably tied to age, as conditions tend to be accumulated over time, but that the prevalence of individual comorbidities or of population health overall can vary regionally [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2008760117].
Several comorbidities that are highly prevalent in older adults, such as COPD, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, have been associated with CFRs upwards of 8% compared to an estimate of 1.4% in people without comorbidities [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16472; @url:https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/report-of-the-who-china-joint-mission-on-coronavirus-disease-2019-(covid-19)]. <!-- will this url work for Manubot?-->
Therefore, both age and health are important considerations when predicting the impact of COVID-19 on a population [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2008760117].
However, other associations may exist, such as patients with sepsis having higher SOFA scores -- in fact, SOFA was developed for the assessment of organ failure in the context of sepsis, and the acronym originally stood for Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment [@doi:10.1007/BF01709751; @doi:10.1001/jama.2016.0287].
Additionally, certain conditions are likely to be more prevalent under or exacerbated by social conditions, especially poverty, as is discussed further below.

#### Ancestry

A number of studies have suggested associations between individuals' racial and ethnic backgrounds and their COVID-19 risk.
In particular, Black Americans are consistently identified as carrying a higher burden of COVID-19 than white Americans [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598; @doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm6925e1], with differences in the rates of kidney complications from COVID-19 particularly pronounced [@doi:10.1016/j.kint.2020.05.006].
Statistics from a number of cities indicate significant discrepancies between the proportion of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Black Americans relative to their representation in the general population [@doi:10/ggv494].
In addition to Black Americans, disproportionate harm and mortality from COVID-19 has also been noted in Latino/Hispanic Americans and in Native American and Alaskan Native communities, including the Navajo nation [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.8598; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m1483; @doi:10.1111/jrh.12451; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-navajo-nation.html?searchResultPosition=10; @url:https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html; @doi:10.1093/tbm/ibaa055].
In Brazil indigenous communities likewise carry an increased burden of COVID-19 [@doi:10.1126/science.abc0073].
In the United Kingdom, nonwhite ethnicity (principally Black or South Asian) was one of several factors found to be associated with a higher risk of death from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2521-4].

From a genetic standpoint, it is highly unlikely that ancestry itself predisposes individuals to contracting COVID-19 or to experiencing severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Examining human genetic diversity indicates variation over a geographic continuum, and that most human genetic variation is associated with the African continent [@doi:10.1038/ng1438].
African-Americans are also a more genetically diverse group relative to European-Americans, with a large number of rare alleles and a much smaller fraction of common alleles identified in African-Americans [@doi:10.1146/annurev.genom.9.081307.164258].
Therefore, the idea that African ancestry (at the continent level) might convey some sort of genetic risk for severe COVID-19 contrasts with what is known about worldwide human genetic diversity [@doi:10.1126/science.abd4842].
The possibility for genetic variants that confer some risk or some protection remains possible, but has not been widely explored, especially at a global level.
Research in Beijing of a small number (n=80) hospitalized COVID-19 patients revealed an association between severe COVID-19 outcomes and homozygosity for an allele in the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene, which was selected as a candidate because it was previously found to be associated with influenza outcomes in Chinese patients [@doi:10.1093/infdis/jiaa224].
Genetic factors may also play a role in the risk of respiratory failure for COVID-19 [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2020283; @doi:10.1093/gerona/glaa131; @doi:10.1101/2020.06.16.155101].
However, genetic variants associated with outcomes within ancestral groups are far less surprising than genetic variants explaining outcomes between groups.
Alleles in _ACE2_ and _TMPRSS2_ have been identified that vary in frequency among ancestral groups [@doi:10.1186/s12916-020-01673-z], but whether these variants are associated with COVID-19 susceptibility has not been explored.

Instead, examining patterns of COVID-19 susceptibility on a global scale that suggest that social factors are of primary importance in predicting mortality.
Reports from several sub-Saharan African countries have indicated that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been less severe than expected based on the outbreaks in China and Italy.
In Kenya, for example, estimates of national prevalence based on testing blood donors for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were consistent with 5% of Kenyan adults having recovered from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1101/2020.07.27.20162693].
This high seroprevalence of antibodies lies in sharp contrast to the low number of COVID-19 fatalities in Kenya, which at the time was 71 out of 2093 known cases [@doi:10.1101/2020.07.27.20162693].
Likewise, a serosurvey of health care workers in Blantyre City, Malawi reported an adjusted antibody prevalence of 12.3%, suggesting that the virus had been circulating more widely than thought and that the death rate was up eight times lower than models had predicted [@doi:10.1101/2020.07.30.20164970].
While several possible hypotheses for the apparent reduced impact of COVID-19 on the African continent are being explored, such as young demographics in many places [@doi:10.1126/science.369.6505.756], these reports present a stark contrast to the severity of COVID-19 in Americans and Europeans of African descent.
Additionally, ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom also tend to be younger than white British living in the same areas, yet the burden of COVID-19 is still more serious for minorities, especially people of Black Caribbean ancestry, both in absolute numbers and when controlling for age and location [@url:https://www.ifs.org.uk/inequality/chapter/are-some-ethnic-groups-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19-than-others/].
Furthermore, the groups in the United States and United Kingdom that have been identified as carrying elevated COVID-19 burden, namely Black American, indigenous American, and Black and South Asian British, are quite distinct in their position on the human ancestral tree.
What is shared across these groups is instead a history of disenfranchisement under colonialism and ongoing systematic racism. 
A large analysis of over 11,000 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in 92 hospitals across U.S. states revealed that Black patients were younger, more often female, more likely to be on Medicaid, more likely to have comorbidities, and came from neighborhoods identified as more economically deprived than white patients [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039].i
This study reported that when these factors were accounted for, the differences in mortality between Black and white patients were no longer significant.
Thus, the current evidence suggests that the apparent correlations between ancestry and health outcomes must be examined in the appropriate social context.

### Social Factors Influencing COVID-19 Outcomes

The evidence clearly indicates that social environmental factors are critical determinants of individuals' and communities' risks related to COVID-19.
There are distinct components to COVID-19 susceptibility, and an individual's risk can be elevated at one or all stages from exposure to recovery/mortality: an individual may be more likely to be exposed to the virus, more likely to get infected once exposed, more likely to have serious complications once infected, be less likely to receive adequate care once they are seriously ill.
The fact that differences in survival between Black and white patients were no longer significant after controlling for comorbidities and socioeconomic status (type of insurance, neighborhood deprivation score, and hospital where treatment was received) in addition to sex and age [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039] underscores the relevance of social factors to understanding mortality differences between racial and ethnic groups.
Moreover, the Black patients were younger and more likely to be female than white patients, yet still had a higher mortality rate without correction for the other variables [@doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.18039].
Here, we outline a few systemic reasons that may exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic in communities of color.

#### Exposure to COVID-19

Social distancing has emerged as one of the main social policies used to manage the COVID-19 epidemic in many countries.
Many governments issued stay-at-home orders, especially in the initial months of the crisis.
However, data clearly indicates that these orders impacted different socioeconomic groups differently.
In U.S. counties with and without stay-at-home orders, smartphone tracking indicated a significant decrease in the general population's mobility in April relative to February through March of 2020 (-52.3% and -60.8%, respectively) [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
A linear relationship was observed between counties' reduction in mobility and their wealth and health, as measured by access to health care, food security, income, space, and other factors [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
Counties with greater reductions in mobility were also found to have much lower child poverty and household crowding and to be more racially segregated, and to have fewer youth and more elderly residents [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624].
Similar associations between wealth and decreased mobility were observed in cellphone GPS data from Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico collected between January and May 2020 [@arXiv:2006.15195].
These disparities in mobility are likely to be related to the role that essential workers have played during the pandemic.
Essential workers are disproportionately likely to be female, people of color, immigrants, and to have an income below 200% of the poverty line [@url:https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf]. 
Black Americans in particular are over-represented among front-line workers and in professions where social distancing is infeasible [@doi:10.1002/ajim.23145].
Health care work in particular presents an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1002/ajim.23145; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0232452; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregistereduptoandincluding20april2020; @url:https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichoccupationshavethehighestpotentialexposuretothecoronaviruscovid19/2020-05-11; @url:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892085/disparities_review.pdf].
In the United Kingdom, (South) Asians are more likely than their white counterparts to be medical professionals [@url:https://www.ifs.org.uk/inequality/chapter/are-some-ethnic-groups-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19-than-others/], although BAME medical professionals are still disproportionately represented in the proportion of National Health Service staff deaths [@url:https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article].
Similar trends have been reported for nurses, especially nurses of color, in the United States [@url:https://act.nationalnursesunited.org/page/-/files/graphics/0920_Covid19_SinsOfOmission_Data_Report.pdf].
Furthermore, beyond the risks associated with work itself, use of public transportation may also impact COVID-19 risk [@url:http://www.nber.org/papers/w27407].
The socioeconomic and racial/ethnic gaps in who is working on the front lines of the pandemic make it clear that socioeconomic privilege is likely to decrease the probability of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. 

Increased risk of exposure can also arise outside the workplace.
Nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities received attention early on as high-risk locations for COVID-19 outbreaks [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.11642].
Prisons and detention centers also confer a high risk of exposure or infection [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.1856; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12528].
Populations in care facilities are largely older adults, and in the United States, incarcerated people are more likely to be male and persons of color, especially Black [@url:https://www.issuelab.org/resources/695/695.pdf].
Additionally, multi-generational households are less common among non-Hispanic white Americans than people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds [@doi:10.1111/j.1751-9020.2010.00306.x], increasing the risk of exposure for more susceptible family members.
Analysis suggests that household crowding may also be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 exposure [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.03.20084624], and household crowding is associated with poverty [@doi:10.1037/12057-014].
Forms of economic insecurity like housing insecurity, which is associated with poverty and more pronounced in communities subjected to racism [@doi:10.7916/D8WH2W9T; @doi:10.1093/socpro/spv025], would be likely to increase household crowding and other possible sources of exposure.
As a result, facets of systemic inequality such as mass incarceration of Black Americans and poverty are likely to increase the risk of exposure outside of the workplace.

#### Severity of COVID-19 Following Exposure

Following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the likelihood that an individual develops COVID-19 and the severity of the disease presentation can be influenced by a number of social factors.
As discussed above, a number of patient characteristics are associated with the likelihood of severe COVID-19 symptoms.
In some cases, these trends run counter to those expected given rates of exposure: for example, although women are more likely to be exposed, men are more likely to be diagnosed with, hospitalized from, or die from COVID-19 [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1008570].
In the case of comorbid conditions and racial/ethnic demographics, however, social factors are highly likely to modulate or at least influence the apparent association between these traits and the increased risk from COVID-19.
In particular, the comorbidities and racial/ethnic correlates of severe COVID-19 outcomes suggest that poverty confers additional risk for COVID-19.

In order to explore the relationship between poverty and COVID-19 outcomes, it is necessary to consider how poverty impacts biology.
In particular, we focus on the United States and the United Kingdom.
In particular, we focus on the United States and the United Kingdom.
Comorbidities that increase risk for COVID-19, including obesity, type II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, are known to be intercorrelated [@doi:10/bpp37d].
Metabolic conditions related to heightened inflammation, like obesity, type II diabetes, and hypertension, are more strongly associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes than other comorbid conditions, such as chronic heart disease [@doi:10.2337/dbi19-0023].
As discussed above, dysregulated inflammation characteristic of cytokine release syndrome is one of the greatest concerns for COVID-19-related death.
Therefore, it is possible that chronic inflammation characteristic of these metabolic conditions predisposes patients to COVID-19-related death [@doi:10.2337/dbi19-0023].
The association between these diseases and severe COVID-19 outcomes is a concern from a health equity perspective because poverty exposes people to "obesogenic" conditions [@doi:10/gddg84] and is therefore unsurprisingly associated with higher incidence of obesity and associated disorders [@doi:10.5604/12321966.1120608].
Furthermore, cell phone GPS data suggests that lower socioeconomic status may also be associated with decreased access to healthy food choices during the COVID-19 pandemic [@doi:10.1002/oby.22940; @doi:10.1002/oby.22993], suggesting that health-related risk factors for COVID-19 may be exacerbated as the pandemic continues [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.07.002].
Chronic inflammation is a known outcome of chronic stress (e.g., [@doi:10.1067/mai.2000.110163; @doi:10.1037//0278-6133.21.6.531; @doi:10.1037/a0025536; @doi:10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00450.x]).
Therefore, the chronic stress of poverty is likely to influence health broadly (as summarized in @doi:10.2307/26061262) and especially during the stress of the ongoing pandemic.

In addition to the influence of chronic stress, other environmental factors associated with poverty may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.
A preprint [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502] provided observational evidence that geographical areas in the United States that suffer from worse air pollution by fine particulate matter have also suffered more COVID-19 deaths per capita, after adjusting for demographic covariates.
Although lack of individual-level exposure data and the impossibility of randomization make it difficult to elucidate the exact causal mechanism, this finding would be consistent with similar findings for all-cause mortality (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1803222115]).
Exposure to air pollution is associated with both poverty (e.g., [@doi:10.3390/ijerph15061114]) and chronic inflammation [@doi:10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.06.002].
Taken together, the evidence suggests that low-income workers who face greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to their home or work conditions are also more likely to face environmental and social stressors associated with increased inflammation, and therefore with increased risk from COVID-19.
In particular, structural racism can play an important role on disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, due to consequences of racism which include an increased likelihood of poverty and its associated food and housing instability.
COVID-19 can thus be considered a "syndemic", or a synergistic interaction between several epidemics [@doi:10.1002/ajhb.23482].
As a result, it is not surprising that people from minoritized backgrounds and/or with certain pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer severe effects of COVID-19, but these "risk factors" are likely to be causally linked to poverty.

#### Access to Treatment

Finally, COVID-19 outcomes can be influenced by access to healthcare.
Receiving care for COVID-19 can, but does not always, include receiving a positive test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
For example, it is common to see treatment guidelines for suspected cases regardless of whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed (e.g., [@doi:10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036]).
Where a patient is diagnosed can depend on their access to testing, which can vary both between and within countries.
In the United States, it is not always clear whether individuals have access to free testing [@url:https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/19/880543755/insurers-may-only-pay-for-coronavirus-tests-when-theyre-medically-necessary; @url:https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2020/private-health-insurance-coverage-covid-19-public-health-emergency].
The concern has been raised that more economic privilege is likely to correspond to increased access to testing, at least within the United States [@doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046].
African Americans may be more likely to be diagnosed in the hospital, while other groups were more likely to have been diagnosed in ambulatory settings in the community [@doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00598].
Any delays in treatment are a cause for concern [@doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046], which could potentially be increased by an inability to acquire testing because in the United States, insurance coverage for care received can depend on a positive test [@url:https://www.hrsa.gov/coviduninsuredclaim/frequently-asked-questions].

Another important question is whether patients with moderate to severe cases are able to access hospital facilities and treatments, to the extent that they have been identified.
Early findings from China as of February 2020 suggested the COVID-19 mortality rate to be much lower in the most developed regions of the country [@doi:10/ggqscd].
Efforts to make treatment accessible for all confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in China are credited with expanding care to people with fewer economic resources [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0823-6].
In the United States, access to healthcare varies widely, with certain sectors of the workforce less likely to have health insurance; many essential workers in transportation, food service, and other frontline fields are among those likely to be uninsured or underinsured [@doi:10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.046].
As of 2018, Hispanic Americans of all races were much less likely to have health insurance than people from non-Hispanic backgrounds [@url:https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.pdf].
Therefore, access to diagnostics and care prior to the development of severe COVID-19 is likely to vary dependent on socioeconomic and social factors, many of which overlap with the risks of exposure and the risk of developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms.
This discrepancy ties into concerns about broad infrastructural challenges imposed by COVID-19.
A major concern in many countries has been the saturation of healthcare systems due to the volume of COVID-19 hospitalization (e.g., [@doi:10.1073/pnas.2004064117]).
Similarly, there have been shortages of supplies such as ventilators that are critical to the survival of many COVID-19 patients, leading to extensive ethical discussions about how to allocate limited resources among patients [@doi:10.19044/esj.2020.v16n21p24; @doi:10.7249/PEA228-1; @arxiv:2008.00374; @doi:10.1016/j.surg.2020.04.044].
Although it is generally considered unethical to consider demographic factors such as age, sex, race, or ethnicity while making such decisions, and ideally this information would not be shared with triage teams tasked with allocating limited resources among patients [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764137], there are substantial concerns about implicit biases against older adults [@doi:10.1111/jgs.16539], premature infants [@doi:10.1111/apa.15334], and people with disabilities or comorbidities [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764138; @doi:10.2105/AJPH.2020.305837; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1764137].
Because of the greater burden of chronic disease in populations subjected to systemic racism, algorithms intended to race and ethnicity could, in fact, reinforce systemic inequalities caused by structural racism [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1777347; @doi:10.1016/j.jnma.2020.05.010; @doi: 10.1056/NEJMp2023616].
Because of this inequality, it can be argued that groups facing health disparities should be prioritized by these algorithms [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
However, this approach would also be rife with ethical concerns.

One of the concerns is that many of the scarce resources that need to be distributed do not have well-established risks and benefits.
As the pandemic has progressed, it has become clear that ICU beds and ventilators are not the only limited resources that needs to be allocated, and, in fact, the survival rate for patients who receive ventilators is lower than these discussions would suggest [@doi:10.1136/medethics-2020-106460].
Allocation of interventions that may reduce suffering, including palliative care, has become critically important [@doi:10.1136/medethics-2020-106460; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1788663]].
The ambiguitie surrounding risks and benefits associated with therapeutics that are approved under emergency use authorizations also present ethical concerns related to the distribution of resources [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
For example, remdesivir, discussed below, is an antiviral produce by Gilead that has shown some promise for alleviating symptoms and reducing the duration of hospitalization.
Remdesivir is currently available for the treatment of COVID-19 under compassionate use guidelines and through expanded access programs, and in many cases has been donated to hospitals by Gilead [@doi:10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.06.016; @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795529].
Regulations guiding the distribution of drugs in situations like these typically do not address how to determine which patients receive them [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795529].
Prioritizing marginalized groups for treatment with a drug like remdesivir would also be unethical because it would entail disproportionately exposing these groups to a therapeutic that may or not be beneficial [@doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795538].
On the other hand, given that the drug is one of the most promising treatments available for many patients, using a framework that tacitly feeds into structural biases would also be unethical.
<!--This would be a great place to move into @tlukan's text in #600 because often they make these drugs available only through clinical trials. Also, @doi:10.1080/15265161.2020.1795541-->


More research is needed for analyzing and remediating these disparities [@doi:10.1093/tbm/ibaa055].
