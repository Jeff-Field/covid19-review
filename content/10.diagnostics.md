### Current Strategies for Diagnosing COVID-19 and Similar Viral Infections

Given the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the development of reliable assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection even in asymptomatic carriers is vitally important. 
For instance, the deployment of wide-scale diagnostic testing followed by the isolation of infected people has been a key factor in South Korea's successful strategy for controlling the spread of the virus. 
Following the first release of the genetic sequence of the virus by Chinese officials on January 10 2020, the first test was released about 13 days later [@doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045]. 
Identifying individuals who have contracted the infection is crucial to slowing down the global pandemic. 
The assays available to date use the following approaches to identify the active virus in patient samples.

#### RT-PCR 

The Drosten Lab, from Germany, was the first lab to establish and validate a diagnostic test to detect SARS-Cov-2. 
This test uses real-time PCR (RT-PCR) [@doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045] to detect several regions of the viral genome: the orf1b of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the Envelope protein gene (E), and the Nucleocapsid protein gene (N). 
In collaboration with several other labs in Europe and in China, the researchers confirmed the specificity of this test with respect to other coronaviruses against specimens from 297 patients infected with a broad range of respiratory agents. 
Specifically this tests utilises two probes against RdRP of which one is specific for COVID-19 [doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045]. Importantly, this assay did not give any false positive outcome.

QRT-tPCR

Around the same time the Hong Kong university developed a Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription PCR (QRT-tPCR) against two region of the virus, orf1b and N region [doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029]. 
Specifically, this assay was tested on samples coming from two SARS-Cov-2 patients, including a panel of positive and negative controls consisting of RNA extracted from several cultured viruses. 
The assay uses the N gene to screen patients, while the orf1b is used to confirm the infection [doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029].
In this case the test was designed to detect sabercoviruses of which COVID-19 belongs. 
Considering that no other sabercoviruses are known to infect human at the moment, if the test comes out positive it means the patient is infected with the virus. 
However, this test does not allow to discriminate the genetics among different viruses. 

Limitation of PCR tests

One advantage of PCR tests it their sensitivity; however, several limitations with these tests introduce challenges to high-throughput testing:

1)	 False-negative responses, which can be a significant problem in a large scale test. In this case a correct execution is crucial [doi: 10.1038/d41587-020-00002-2]. 

2)	Uncertainty of the SARS-Cov-2 viral shedding kinetics, which may affect the result of test if not taken at the right time [doi: 10.1038/d41587-020-00002-2].

3)	Type of Specimen, as it is not clear which clinical sample is best to detect the virus [doi: 10.1038/d41587-020-00002-2].

4)	Expensive machinaries, which might be present in major hospital and or diagnostic centers, but not in smaller facilities [doi:10.1126/science.abb8400]. 

5)	Timing of the test, which might take up to 4 days to give results [doi:10.1126/science.abb8400].

CRSPR test

Recently, two American companies, Mammoth Biosciences and Sherlock Biosciences, proposed to use CRISPR technology [10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.010]to implement the speed of Coronavirus diagnostic test [doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032334]. 
Their methodology includes RNA extraction from patient specimen; loop-mediated amplification (fast amplification) of the RNA; addition of the CRISPR reagents: CAS12, which cut the DNA or RNA, and the RNA guidance. 
The RNA guidance helps CAS12 to direct the cut of a sequence corresponding to a piece of the coronavirus genome. 
With this test, If CAS12 and its guide find a match in the RNA, then the cut occurs and the patient is positive to the novel Coronavirus. Specifically, when CAS12 is active it also cuts a designed strand containing molecules that change color once they are free [doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032334. 
This test can be as fast as 30 minutes and the result can be as simple as a color change on a strip [doi:10.1126/science.abb8400].

Limitation of CRISPR test

Fake-positives due to the specificity of the technique, as the guide RNA can recognise other interspersed sequences on the patientâ€™s genome.

Sierological tests

Despite diagnostic tests based on the detection of the genetic material can be quite sensitive, they cannot provide information about the real extent of the disease. In fact, they would not work on a recovered patient who defeated the virus. 
In this context, immunity tests can be significantly more informative. 
In fact, they can help scientists figuring out why the disease has different course among patients, as well as what strategy might work to manage the spread of the infection. 
Furthermore, sierological tests are crucial for the economic re-start of the hit area. 
For instance, people that have developed antibodies can return to work prior to the others, helping to develop the herd immunity which will prevent further diffusion of the virus.
Several countries are now focused on implementing antibody tests and the FDA recently approved a sierological test by Cellex under emergency condition [https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download].
Specifically, the Cellex qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test is a chromatographic immunoassay designed to qualitatively detect IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 in the plasma of patients suspected to have developed the infection [https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download]. 
Such test allows to understand the progress of the viral disease. Specifically, IgM are the first antibodies produced by the body and indicate that the infection is in action. 
Once the body has responded to the infection, IgG are produced and gradually replace IgM, indicating that the body has developed immunogenic memory [doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25820]. 
The test cassette contains a pad of SARS-Cov-2 antigens and a nitrocellulose strip with lines for each of IgG and IgM, as well as a control (goat IgG) [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download].
In a specimen that contains antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the antibodies will bind to the strip and be captured by the IgM and/or IgG line(s), resulting in a change of color [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download]. 
With this particular assay results can be read within 15-20 minutes [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download]. 
Importantly, false positives can occur due to cross-reactivity with other antibodies depending on the clinical condition of the patient [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download]. 
Therefore, this test should be used in combination with RNA detection tests [@url:https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download].
