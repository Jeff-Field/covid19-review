## Discussion

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, the scientific community has responded by rapidly collecting and disseminating information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its ability to infect humans and other animals.
This fundamental information has allowed for innovations in the areas of diagnostics and therapeutics that continue to be proposed and developed upon.
In this review, we seek to explain the scientific rationale underlying these technologies and to critically evaluate the literature available about them.

### Current State of Diagnostics

### Current State of Therapeutics

### Concerns about Equity in Healthcare

Scientific and medical research broadly is shaped by a number of biases, such as Eurocentrism, that are of significant concern in the face of a global pandemic.
Some concerns include: 
1. Who is being included in clinical trials?
2. While biotechnological developments are exciting, how likely are they to be available to people broadly?
3. Even this review is likely biased (e.g., we look at traditional western medicine in the nutraceuticals section and mainly report statistics from US and other data collection services)
