## Discussion

<!-- This section is a stub. Additional work is needed to flesh this section out. Outlining or writing help is welcome!-->
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, the scientific community has responded by rapidly collecting and disseminating information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its ability to infect humans and other animals.
This fundamental information has allowed for innovations in the areas of diagnostics and therapeutics that continue to be proposed and developed upon.
In this review, we seek to explain the scientific rationale underlying these technologies and to critically evaluate the literature available about them.

### Current State of Diagnostics

### Current State of Therapeutics

The majority of current clinical trials and lines of investigation have focused on repurposing existing therapies to counter SARS-CoV-2 and treat its symptoms.
This approach is necessary given the urgency of the situation as well as the extensive time required for developing and testing new therapies.
However, in the long-term, new drugs specific for treatment of COVID-19 may also enter development.
There is thus value in investigating two lines of inquiry for treatment of COVID-19: 1) new therapeutics specific for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms, and 2) repurposing of existing therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19 or its symptoms.
Here we consider further avenues that scientific investigators may explore in the development of therapies for COVID-19.

While studies of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have not supported the early theoretical interest in this antiviral treatment, it may be of interest to explore alternatives with similar mechanisms.
For example, hydroxyferroquine derivatives of HCQ have been described as a class of bioorganometallic compounds that exert antiviral effects with some selectivity for SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1021/jm0601856].
Future work could explore whether these compounds exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and whether they are safe for use in animals and humans.

The tocilizumab trial described in an above section [@doi:10/ggnxb3] studies the possibility of using an anti-inflammatory agent typically used for the treatment of autoimmune disease to counter the effects of the “cytokine storm” induced by the virus.
Another anti-IL-6 antibody, sarilumab, is also being investigated [@url:http://www.news.sanofi.us/2020-03-16-Sanofi-and-Regeneron-begin-global-Kevzara-R-sarilumab-clinical-trial-program-in-patients-with-severe-COVID-19; @clinicaltrials:NCT04327388].
Typically, immunosuppressive drugs such as these are contraindicated in the setting of infection [@doi:10.1177/2040622313485275].
However, COVID-19 results in hyperinflammation that appears to contribute to mortality via lung damage, suggesting that immunosuppression may be a helpful approach to treatment [@doi:10/ggnzmc].
The decision of whether and/or when to counter hyperinflammation with immunosuppression in the setting of COVID-19 remains in debate as the risks of inhibiting antiviral immunity continue to be weighed against the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10/ggq8hs].
If the need to curtail the “cytokine storm” inflammatory response to the virus transcends the risks of immunosuppression, exploration of more anti-inflammatory agents may be warranted; these agents are considered here.
While tocilizumab targets IL-6, several other inflammatory markers could be potential targets, including TNF-alpha. Inhibition of TNF-alpha by an inhibitor such as Etanercept has been previously suggested for treatment of SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1185/030079903125002757] and may be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 as well.
Baricitinib and other small molecule inhibitors of the JAK kinase pathway also curtail the inflammatory response and have been suggested as potential options for SARS-CoV-2 infections [@doi:10/dph5].
Baricitinib in particular may be able to reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect lung cells [@doi:10/ggnrsx].
Clinical trials studying baricitinib in COVID-19 have already begun in the US and in Italy [@url:https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-begins-clinical-testing-therapies-covid-19; @clinicaltrials:NCT04320277].
Identification and targeting of further inflammatory markers that are relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be of value for curtailing the inflammatory response and lung damage.
Lastly, it is also worth noting the high costs of tocilizumab therapy and other biologics: at doses used for rheumatoid arthritis patients, the cost for tocilizumab ranges from $179.20 to $896 per dose for the IV form and $355 for the pre-filled syringe [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349513/table/T43/].
Cyclosporine may be a more cost-effective and readily-available alternative than biologics [@url:https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/meyers_pp/385], if it proves effective against the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2.

Another approach is the development of antivirals, which could be broad-spectrum, specific to coronaviruses, or targeted to SARS-CoV-2.
Given the increasingly apparent role of the cytokine storm in disease pathogenesis, it is possible that antivirals could be less effective in more severe cases of COVID-19, but this is not yet known; regardless, it is likely that early-stage patients could benefit from antiviral therapy.
The potential for remdesivir as an antiviral has already been described in an above section.
Development of new antivirals is complicated by the fact that none have yet been approved for human coronaviruses.
Intriguing new options are emerging, however.
Beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is an orally bioavailable ribonucleotide analog showing broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses, which may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883].
Various other antivirals are in development.
Development of antivirals will be further facilitated as research reveals more information about the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cell and host cell genome, mechanisms of viral replication, mechanisms of viral assembly, and mechanisms of viral release to other cells; this can allow researchers to target specific stages and structures of the viral life cycle.

Antibodies against viruses, also known as antiviral monoclonal antibodies, could be an alternative as well and are described in detail in an above section.
The goal of antiviral antibodies is to neutralize viruses through either cell-killing activity or blocking of viral replication [@doi:10.1016/j.tim.2015.07.005].
They may also engage the host immune response, encouraging the immune system to hone in on the virus.
Given the cytokine storm that results from immune system activation in response to the virus, which has been implicated in worsening of the disease, a neutralizing antibody (nAb) may be preferable.
Upcoming work may explore the specificity of nAbs for their target, mechanisms by which the nAbs impede the virus, and improvements to antibody structure that may enhance the ability of the antibody to block viral activity.

There is also some research into possible potential therapeutics or prophylactics which interact with components of the innate immune response.
For example, there are a variety of toll-like receptors (TLRs) which are examples of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), innate immune response components which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).
Note that TLRs form a part of innate immune recognition and can more generally contribute to promoting both innate and adaptive responses [@ISBN:9780815332183].
In mouse models, poly(I:C) and CpG, which are agonists of toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR9, respectively, showed protective effects when administered prior to SARS-CoV infection [@doi:10.1128/JVI.01410-12].
Therefore, TLR agonists hold some potential for broad-spectrum prophylaxis.
Another type of approach which is being investigated is the possible use of what is termed trained immunity, in particular as elicited by non-SARS-CoV-2 whole-microorganism vaccines (or other microbial stimuli), as a tool which might be shown to generate heterologous protective effects with respect to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or severity [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042].
In a recent review [@doi:10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6], trained immunity was defined as forms of memory which are temporary (e.g., months or years, and reversible), displayed by innate immune cells and innate immune features of other cells, displayed as increased responsiveness to future same or heterologous pathogen infection or sometimes decreased responsiveness or immunological tolerance, and established through epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms.
One type of stimulus which research indicates can induce trained immunity is bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination.
BCG is an attenuated form of bacteria _Mycobacterium bovis_.
The vaccine is most commonly administered for the prevention of tuberculosis in humans.
With respect to SARS-CoV-2 specifically, clinical trials in non-SARS-CoV-2-infected adults have been setup to assess the possible efficacy of BCG vaccination -- e.g., to assess if it may be effective as a potential prophylactic or potential partial prophylactic in (1) reducing susceptibility / preventing infection and (2) reducing disease severity (for descriptions of trials with BCG vaccine or the related vaccine VPM1002, see [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042; @clinicaltrials:NCT04327206; @clinicaltrials:NCT04328441; @clinicaltrials:NCT04348370; @clinicaltrials:NCT04350931; @clinicaltrials:NCT04362124; @clinicaltrials:NCT04369794; @clinicaltrials:NCT04373291; @clinicaltrials:NCT04379336; @clinicaltrials:NCT04384549; @clinicaltrials:NCT04387409; @clinicaltrials:NCT04414267; @clinicaltrials:NCT04417335; @clinicaltrials:NCT04435379; @clinicaltrials:NCT04439045]).
Some trials enroll healthcare workers, other trials hospitalized elderly adults without immunosuppression who get vaccinated with placebo or BCG at hospital discharge, and yet another set of trials older adults (>50 years) under chronic care for conditions like hypertension and diabetes.
One set of trials, for example, uses time until first infection as the primary study endpoint; more generally, outcomes measured in some of these trials are related to incidence of disease and disease severity or symptoms.
An article [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042] that very briefly summarizes the setup of these trials also mentions some data analyses which showed possible correlations between countries which have more BCG vaccination (or BCG vaccination policies) and the severity of COVID-19 in those countries, but (1) it is unclear whether this correlation indicates an interaction because for example of many other possible factors or confounding factors (country age distribution, detection efficiency, stochastic epidemic dynamic effects, differences in healthcare capacity over time in relation to epidemic dynamics, and various other factors) and (2) also it is unclear what is the relation between BCG vaccination at different ages and at longer times before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and BCG vaccination at different ages during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic at shorter times before the risk of possible infection; at least some of these considerations are also made or pointed out in the data analyses sited and in the article.
The article [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042] also includes various related considerations such as efficacy in related animal and human studies and the safety of the vaccine, both generally and specifically with respect to SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, we review here one of the most important considerations: severe SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized so far to possibly exhibit dysregulated immune responses and whether or when some immune responses are protective or pathogenic is still under research (e.g., [@doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009; @doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.009; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042; @doi:10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.008]); also, trained immunity itself may sometimes be related to either balanced, or too much or too little, or useful or harmful immunological responses.
The article [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.042] proposes that trained immunity might lead to an earlier stronger response which could reduce viremia and avoid (possibly with the additional support of another therapeutic administered later) the later detrimental immunopathology seen with severe cases; while this is a possibility, additional research is required to assess its validity.

In the longer term, as more information becomes available about the structures of SARS-CoV-2 components, small molecule inhibitors of those components may become candidates for drug discovery.
For example, crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease have recently been resolved [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882; @url:https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html].
Efforts have already been in place to perform screens for small molecule inhibitors of the main protease, yielding potential hits [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.26.964882].
Much work remains to be done to determine further crystal structures of other viral components, understand the relative utility of targeting different viral components, perform additional small molecule inhibitor screens, and determine the safety and efficacy of the potential inhibitors.
While still nascent, work in this area is promising.

### Concerns about Equity in Healthcare

Scientific and medical research broadly is shaped by a number of biases.
Some concerns include how clinical trials recruit and operate.

<!--Risk of comorbid health conditions associated with more severe outcomes may be influenced by long-term damage caused by chronic stress related to traumatic social experiences [@doi:10.1007/s12170-013-0338-5], perhaps mediated by cardiovascular risk factors [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.10.20097253], although the effects of chronic stress have not yet been researched in the specific case of COVID-19 disparities.-->
