## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China describing 44 cases of a respiratory infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan within China and subsequently around the world.
At the time of the WHO's first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified, primarily in China, but also 1-2 exported cases had been identified in several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
On April 4, 2020, the WHO reported that the number of confirmed cases had surpassed one million globally [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200404-sitrep-75-covid-19.pdf].
The number of cases continues to rise daily, with up-to-date numbers tracked by sources such as Google [@url:https://www.google.com/search?q=google+covid+counts].

<!--Note: Maybe add a graph here, update as new reports come out.
So this is where manubot is particularly useful. it could pull from a public database / data table.
-->

Some review articles on aspects of COVID-19 have already been published and may be of great usefulness.
These have included reviews on the disease epidemiology [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2020.02.008], immunological response [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002], and pharmacological treatments [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.002].
However, research on these topics is proceeding so quickly that any static review is likely to quickly become dated.

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases.
Further, we aim to amplify the true signal out of the vast noise produced by thousands of publications on the topic [@doi:10.1038/s42254-020-0175-7].
We will critique, sort and distill informative contents out of the overwhelming flood of information and help the larger scientific community to be better educated on this critical subject affecting all of us.
This is a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.

### About Coronaviruses

### COVID-19: Infection and Presentation

#### Pathogenic Mechanisms of Coronaviruses

Until more information becomes available about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 specifically, insight can be gained by examining how the human body responds to viral pathogens generally, how infection from related viruses proceeds, and how this information intersects with what is known about COVID-19.
Following exposure to a pathogen such as a virus, pathogenesis involves three major components: entry, replication, and spread [@isbn:0-9631172-1-1 {chap. 45}]. 
The human immune response is double-pronged, with the innate and adaptive immune responses playing distinct roles.
Through innate immunity, the body can rapidly recognize and attack pathogens and infected cells. 
Cells from innate immunity also pass critical information to prime the adaptive immune response.
Adaptive immunity can be broadly classified into the humoral and cell-mediated responses. 
These are distinct from the innate immune responses because they target specific protein sequences from pathogens. 
The humoral response includes soluble proteins and antibodies that can neutralize and eliminate pathogens in circulation that have not yet entered cells, and can also mediate killing of pathogen-infected cells. 
Cell-mediated responses include the killing of pathogen-infected cells by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and the secretion of cytokines to drive inflammation and support immune cell activities.
The antibody-mediated response works to prevent or reduce entry into cells, while the cell-mediated response works to stop the pathogen's replication and spread.

##### SARS-CoV-2 and the Immune Response

The first line of defense for the immune system is physical barriers such as the skin and mucus, but viruses such as SARS-CoV that infect the epithelium are able to bypass these defenses [@doi:10.1038/mi.2015.127].
The innate immune response targets pathogens in circulation.
This response depends on several types of leukocytes (white blood cells) that are professional phagocytic cells, which means they are able to detect and engulf an antigen, enveloping it in a phagosome.
The conditions within the phagosome are then modulated to destroy the pathogen through fusion of the phagosome with a lysosome or granule to form a phagolysosome.
This allows the cell to break the pathogen into its component peptides. 
Monocytes, which include both dendritic cells and macrophages, are both phagocytic white blood cells and professional antigen-presenting cells, which meaning that they can then present the resulting viral peptides on the cell surface using Major Histocompatability Complex II (MHC-II) proteins.
However, research in related viruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may possess some mechanisms that facilitate evasion of the antibody-mediated response.
_In vitro_ analysis of nidoviruses including SARS-CoV suggests that these viruses can induce the development of double-membrane vesicles, preventing the dsRNA signature from being detected by the host immune system [@doi:10.1128/jvi.02501-05].
This protective envelope can therefore insulate these coronaviruses from the innate immune response's detection mechanism [@doi:10.1016/j.jpha.2020.03.001].
Presentation of the antigen is important because this step allows it to be detected by B-lymphocytes, also called B-cells, which are a type of white blood cell with antibodies bound to the membrane.
Individual B-cells have unique membrane-bound antibodies.
A B-cell is able to bind to an antigen only if its antibody is a match.
For example, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) can detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) present during viral replication, allowing it to recognize a viral threat.
The binding of a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), such as a TLR, to the antigen allows the B-cell to engulf it the virus via endocytocis.
Once the antigen has been processed and presented on the cell surface, helper T-cells can bind to the MHC-II/antigen complex.
This second binding step catalyzes the release of cytokines as part of the inflammatory response, as well as the proliferation of active B-cells (plasma cells) capable of producing the antibodies that respond to the antigen.
Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV are also able to evade the humoral immune response through other mechanisms, such as inhibiting certain cytokine pathways or down-regulating antigen presentation by the cells [@doi:10.1128/jvi.02501-05].
Additionally, the cell will produce memory B-cells that can retain information about how to respond to future immune challenges by this pathogen.
Understanding the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 is important because this component of the immune response works to reduce the severity of infection in the short term and is also the mechanism through which the body can respond to reexposure.

Research on other coronaviruses provides some evidence of how the innate immune response may proceed in the presence of SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, belong to five classes that describe which antigens they bind to.
Two of the most common immunoglobulin classes are immunoglobulin M (IgM), which are the first antibodies produced in response to an infection, and immunoglobulin G (IgG), which are the most common antibodies found in the blood.
When an antibody binds to an antigen, it forms a complex can then be cleared by the liver or spleen or through the complement cascade.
Following SARS infection, IgM antibodies were first detected in most patients during the second week following infection and remained detectable until the twelfth week, while IgG antibodies were first detected in the second or third week and remained at close to their peak concentration through the thirteen weeks of the study [@doi:10.1056/NEJM200307313490520].
A two-year longitudinal study following convalesced SARS patients with a mean age of 29 found that IgG antibodies were detectable in all 56 patients surveyed for at least 16 months, and remained detectable in all but 4 (11.8%) of patients through the full two-year study period [@doi:10.1086/500469].
Understanding the innate immune response to viral exposure and the mechanisms that allow viruses to evade these mechanisms will be critical for understanding the therapeutic interventions that are being considered for COVID-19.
The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 is important because this component of the immune response works to reduce the severity of infection in the short term and is also the mechanism through which the body can respond to reexposure.

##### The Adaptive Immune Response

##### The Inflammatory Response and the Cytokine Storm

#### Clinical Presentation of COVID-19

Retrospective samples of COVID-19 patients described the clinical presentations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 which included lower respiratory tract infection with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] noted that upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common, which suggests that the virus targets cells located in the lower respiratory tract.
The symptoms of infection by SARS-CoV-2 can vary greatly, making it difficult for public health agencies to provide clear recommendations for citizens regarding what symptoms indicate infection and should prompt isolation.
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, as well as high levels of d-dimer.
Mortality might be associated with other biomarkers measured in blood samples including lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, although these analyses may not have been appropriately corrected for multiple testing.
They also found that survivors continued to shed the virus for a median of 20 days and a maximum of at least 37 days.

#### Molecular Mechanisms of COVID-19

- How can we evaluate the human response to SARS-CoV-2 on a molecular level?
- What can omics technologies tell us about changes in the body following SARS-CoV-2 infection?

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to become the third coronavirus causing severe pneumonia in humans to emerge in the 21st century [@doi:10.1016/bs.aivir.2018.01.001]. 
Therefore, most of our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 infects cells is obtained from studies on previously identified coronaviruses. 
The entry of a coronavirus into a target cell is mediated by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to a specific cellular receptor and the subsequent priming/cleavage of the S protein by cellular proteases [@doi:10/cf8chz; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792]. 
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have been identified as a prime receptor and a critical protease, respectively, facilitating SARS-CoV/CoV-2 entry into a target cell [@doi:10.1038/nature02145; @doi:10.1126/science.abb2507; @doi:10.1128/JVI.01542-10; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1128/JVI.02232-10]. 
This finding has led to a hypothesized role for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in determining which cells, tissues and organs are most likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Recent clinical investigations of COVID-19 patients have detected SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93% of specimens), sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), fibrobronchoscopy brush biopsies (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%), feces (29%) and blood (1%) [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3786]. 
Two studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the urine specimens [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3786; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3204]; however, a third study identified four urine samples (out of 58) that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids [@doi:10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774]. 
Respiratory failure remains the leading cause of death for COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1111/his.14134]. 
Besides major pulmonary damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage many other organ systems including the heart [@doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950], kidney [@doi:10.1038/s41585-020-0319-7; @doi:10.1186/s13054-020-02872-z], liver [@doi:10/ggpx6s], and gastrointestinal tract [@doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.055; @doi:10.1111/1751-2980.12851].
It can even cause neurological complications [@doi:10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.031]. 
As it becomes clearer that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage multiple organs, the scientific community is pursuing multiple avenues of investigation in order to build a consensus about how the virus affects the human body.
To quickly associate the clinical outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers are taking advantage of “omics” technologies to profile the expression of coronavirus entry factors across the tissues.

### Approaches to Understanding COVID-19

Scientific characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and of the COVID-19 disease it causes is critical to controlling the current pandemic.
Several broad areas of research interact with each other, offering different pieces of information critical to understanding the virus and disease.
A comprehensive understanding of the epidemic must unify basic scientific and medical research with public health and biotechnology.

#### Science & Medicine

Understanding how the virus functions and interacts with the host is foundational to understanding pathogenesis and disease progression and to identifying available and novel approaches to treatment.
Therefore, the fields of virology, immunology, and molecular biology are fundamental to characterizing SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
These topics can be approached using a range of techniques, including characterization of the host response from the cellular to systems level.
Contextualizing SARS-CoV-2 in relation to other viruses that infect humans and other animals can further serve to elucidate the reaction of the human host to viral exposure.
This information, when combined with an understanding of the biology of pharmaceutical and medical interventions, can guide new approaches to treatment.

#### Public Health

One necessary component of determining how to manage the outbreak is to understand epidemiological factors related to the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These can include characteristics such as when infected individuals are contagious, how the virus is transmitted between individuals, the range of symptoms associated with infection and/or contagiousness in different individuals, and how rapidly the virus propagates between individuals, etc.
The development of diagnostic tools is critical to this goal.
Accurate diagnoses on a large scale is necessary to collect the data needed to develop epidemiological models.
Other areas of public health that address resource availability, inequity, human behavior, and other components that influence people's exposure to pathogens and ability to manage illness will also be critical to mounting a global response to the pandemic.
Public health strategies to manage epidemics include anticipation and early detection of emerging diseases (aided by rapid development of diagnostics), containment (using strategies to test, trace and isolate such as widespread testing, contact tracing, quarantining and isolation), control and mitigation of spread (including social distancing), and elimination and eradication. 
An effective public health response requires response coordination, disease surveillance and intervention monitoring, risk communication and health education (including education about personal protective equipment and hand hygiene and containment of “infodemics” of false information), non-pharmaceutical measures to prevent and reduce transmission, and health interventions such as vaccines and other pharmaceuticals that can reduce transmission, curb morbidity and mortality, and mitigate the effects on health systems and other sectors of society [@url:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/managing-epidemics-interactive.pdf].
Currently, this manuscript focuses primarily on contextualizing epidemiological characteristics such as reproduction number and dynamics of transmission that intersect with the fundamental biology of the virus or the development of therapeutic and diagnostic technologies.

#### Biotechnology

##### Diagnostics

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.
The development of high-throughput, affordable methods for detecting active infections and sustained immunity will be critical to understanding and controlling the disease.

- What are approaches that allow us to detect current infection or past exposure for other viruses?
- What is sustained immunity and what are the indicators?

##### Therapeutics

The identification of interventions that can mitigate the effect of the virus on exposed and infected individuals is a significant research priority.
Some possible approaches include the identification of existing pharmaceuticals that reduce the severity of infection, either by reducing the virus' virulence (e.g., antivirals) or managing the most severe symptoms of infection.
Due to the long timeline for the development of novel pharmaceuticals, in most cases, research surrounding possible pharmaceutical interventions focuses on the identification and investigation of existing compounds whose mechanisms may be relevant to COVID-19.
Other foci of current research include the identification of antibodies produced by survivors of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.
Understanding the mechanisms describing host-virus interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2 are thus critical to identifying candidate therapeutics.

### Summary
In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
We include information from both traditional peer-reviewed scientific literature and from preprints, which typically have not undergone peer review but have been critically evaluated by the scientists involved in this effort.
The goal of this manuscript is to present preliminary findings within the broader context of COVID-19 research and to identify the broad interpretations of new research, as well as limitations to interpretability.
