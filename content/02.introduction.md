## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China about 44 cases of a respiratory infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan within China and subsequently around the world.
At the time of the first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified, primarily in China, but also 1-2 exported cases had been identified in several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
On April 4, 2020, the WHO reported that the global number of confirmed cases had surpassed one million [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200404-sitrep-75-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=99251b2b_4].
At this time, over 130,000 deaths had been reported due to COVID-19 worldwide (April 15, 2020).

[Note: Maybe add a graph here, update as new reports come out.]
[So this is where manubot is particularly useful. it could pull from a public database / data table.]

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases.
This is a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.


### About Coronaviruses

#### Classification:

Coronaviruses (CoVs; order *Nidovirales*, family *Coronaviridae*, subfamily *Orthocoronavirinae*) are enveloped viruses with some of the largest viral RNA genomes and helical capsids with the solar corona-like appearance [@isbn:0781760607].
All viruses in the *Nidovirales* order are characterized by: 1) enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA genomes with a highly conserved genomic organization; 2) many non-structural genes by ribosomal shifting; 3) several unusual enzymatic activities encoded within the replicase-transcriptase polyprotein; and 4) 3' nested sub-genomic mRNAs [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1].
Coronaviruses are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses.
Among them, alpha and beta coronaviruses infect mammalian species, gamma coronaviruses infect avian species and delta coronaviruses infect both mammalian and avian species [@doi:10.1146/annurev-virology-110615-042301].
The viruses were initially subdivided into these genera based on antigenic relationships of the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins but are now divided by phylogenetic clustering.

Most coronaviruses are considered zoonotic viruses with little to no transmission observed in humans.
A major group of coronaviruses include human coronaviruses (HCoVs) strains associated with multiple respiratory diseases of varying severity, ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia, with severe symptoms mostly observed in immunocompromised individuals [@doi:10.1086/377612].
Approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans is attributable to four out of six previously known human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) that are globally circulating in the human population [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9;@doi:10.3390/diseases4030026].
In the past two decades, however, highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have been identified, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) although both infections were confined to specific geographic regions [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81;@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9].
The current pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents an acute and rapidly spreading global health crisis with severe or fatal symptoms such as acute respiratory distress, acute lung injury and other pulmonary complications.
The transmission and mortality rate estimations of COVID-19 remain to be determined.

[this section may be better as a figure panel + legend]
Phylogenetic analysis of a PCR amplicon fragment from five patients along with the total virus genome of 29.8 kilobases indicates that the virus is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the B lineage, also known as sarbecovirus.
The sarbecovirus lineage also includes the human SARS coronavirus [@doi:10/ggjs7j].


#### Virion, morphology, structure:
Coronavirus virions are spherical with diameters ranging between 100 to 160nm.
The virion has a lipid envelope with spike (S) glycoproteins on the surface creating a distinctive "crown" shape, for which the family of viruses was named [@isbn:0781760607].


#### Genome structure and replication:
Coronavirus genomes are single-stranded non-segmented positive RNA (ssRNA+) that are 27 to 32kb in length.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome lies in the middle of this range at 29,903 bp in length [@doi:10/ggjr43].
Coronavirus genomes are comprised of a replicase gene that is 2/3 of the genome and the remaining 1/3 that encodes structural proteins including: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.
There are additional accessory genes that are present depending on the strain.
The non-structural polypeptide is translated into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16, except Gammacoronaviruses that do not contain nsp1), which form replication machinery to synthesize viral RNA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25681].

Replication initiates with the binding of the virus to a host cell via the S protein.
The viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane to release the viral genome into the host cytoplasm.
The replicase gene is translated and assembled into the viral replicase complex, which can synthesize dsRNA genome from the genomic ssRNA(+).
The dsRNA genome is then transcribed and replicated to create viral mRNAs and new ssRNA(+) genomes [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1; @url:https://viralzone.expasy.org/30?outline=all_by_species].

#### Transmission:
In general, respiratory viruses like coronavirus can have multiple routes of person-to-person transmission including droplet transmission (i.e. inhalation for cough, sneeze), aerosol transmission (i.e. virus suspended in air), and contact transmission (i.e. contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes).
While there does not appear to be experimental evidence to conclude which mode of transmission different coronaviruses use [@doi:10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9], it is suggested that the coronavirus person-to-person transmission is droplet-based using simulations [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa032867] and trace studies[@doi:10.3390/ijerph15122757].

### Origin of SARS-CoV-2
[MERS and SARS? Where to put this?]
[Specifically about SARS-CoV-2/COVID19?]
The origin of the SARS-CoV-19 virus is not yet fully understood.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-19 is unlikely to have originated from a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].
Among known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-19 has the closest overall sequence similarity to RaTG13 (~96%) found in a *Rhinolophus affinis* bat [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7], while the receptor binding domain (RBD) is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This suggests that SARS-CoV-19 may have originated in viral reservoirs of similar hosts, however current evidence cannot discriminate an origin of the virus before or after zoonotic transfer to humans [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

### Disease (COVID19)

#### Mechanisms of Coronavirus-driven Disease in Humans

Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans through the following possible mechanisms...[Summarize relevant mechanisms for cell entry & address evidence for/against ACE2 being important]

#### Symptoms

*Presentation of COVID-19:*
Information is rapidly becoming available about the wide range of symptoms that can be associated with COVID-19 as well as the range of symptom severity, onset from exposure, and possible risk or protective factors...

Retrospective samples of COVID-19 patients described the clinical presentations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 which included lower respiratory tract infection with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] noted that upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common, which suggests that the virus targets cells located in the lower respiratory tract.
The symptoms of infection by SARS-CoV-2 can vary greatly, making it difficult for public health agencies to provide clear recommendations for citizens regarding what symptoms indicate infection and should prompt isolation.
[@doi:10/ggnxb3] found that a higher probability of mortality was associated with older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, as well as high levels of d-dimer.
Mortality might be associated with other biomarkers measured in blood samples including lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I, although these analyses may not have been appropriately corrected for multiple testing.
They also found that survivors continued to shed the virus for a median of 20 days and a maximum of at least 37 days.

#### Vaccines for Viruses: Strategies for and challenges to development

Generally, the first step in producing a vaccine is characterizing the target.
The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published on January 11, 2020, which aided the global effort to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating global health agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As of April 8, 2020, there were 115 vaccine candidates to prevent COVID-19, of which 78 were active.
Of the 78 active vaccine programs, 73 were in the preclinical or exploratory stage [@doi:10.1038/d41573-020-00073-5].

Historically, an H1N1 influenza vaccine was developed relatively efficiently, mainly because influenza-vaccine technology had already been developed and regulatory agencies had already decided that vaccines produced using egg- and cell-based platforms could be licensed under the regulations used for a strain change.
Critiques of the experience producing and distributing the H1N1 vaccine have stressed the need for alternative development-and-manufacturing platforms that can be readily adapted to new pathogens.
Although a monovalent H1N1 vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the United States and Europe, it was available soon afterward as a stand-alone vaccine that was eventually incorporated into the commercially available seasonal influenza vaccines [@doi:10.1056/NEJMp2005630].
If H1N1 vaccine development provides any indication, considering developing and manufacturing platforms for promising COVID-19 vaccine trials early could hasten the emergence of an effective prophylactic vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Unlike many global vaccine development programs previously, such as with H1N1, the vaccine development landscape for COVID-19 includes vaccines produced by a wide array of technologies.
Experience in the field of oncology is encouraging COVID-19 vaccine developers to use next-generation approaches to vaccine development, which have led to the great diversity of vaccine development programs [@url:https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/newer-vaccine-technologies-deployed-to-develop-covid-19-shot-67152].
Diverse technology platforms include DNA, RNA, virus-like particle, recombinant protein, both replicating and non-replicating viral vectors, live attenuated virus, and inactivated virus approaches.
Given the wide range of vaccines under development, it is possible that some vaccine products may eventually be shown to be more effective in certain subpopulations, such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, the elderly, etc.

#### Diagnostics and Therapeutics for Viruses

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.

Within therapeutics, some possible efforts include efforts to identify strategies for the management of symptoms as well as the development of antivirals...

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.
