## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individual’s immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10/ggkd3b]. 
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.

##### Nutraceuticals
Considering the current pandemic, scientists and the medical community are scrambling to repurpose or discover novel host-directed therapies for which nutraceuticals hold some promise.
Nutraceuticals are classified as supplements with health benefits beyond their basic nutritional value designed for the prophylaxis and treatment of disease [@doi:10.1080/10408390902841529; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
Nutraceuticals purported to boost the immune response, reduce  immunopathology, exhibit antiviral activities or prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are being considered for their potential therapeutic value [@doi:ggkd3b].
A host of potential candidates have been highlighted in the literature that target various aspects of the COVID-19 viral pathology, while others are thought to prime the host immune system.
These include vitamins and minerals along with extracts and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707].
Considerable evidence in vitro and in vivo suggests that nutraceuticals containing phycocyanobilin, N-acetylcysteine, glucosamine, selenium or phase 2 inductive nutraceuticals (e.g. ferulic acid, lipoic acid, or sulforaphane) can prevent or modulate RNA virus infections via amplification of the signaling activity of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and activation of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007].

Another potential nutraceutical that has exhibited beneficial effects against various viral infections is n-3 PUFA [@doi:10.1002/jmv.25707], such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
N-3 PUFA nutraceuticals can mediate inflammation and they have the capacity to modulate the adaptive immune response [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04374.x; @doi:10.3390/molecules22111964; @doi:10.1038/nrcardio.2016.103].
One potential mechanism by which n-3 PUFA could exert beneficial effects against viral infections is by acting as precursor molecules for the biosynthesis of endogenous specialised proresolving mediators (SPM) like protectins and resolvins that actively resolve inflammation and infection [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2014.02.009]. 
SPM have exhibited beneficial effects against a variety of lung infections including RNA viruses [@https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2015.4].
Indeed, protectin D1 has been shown to increase survival from H1N1 viral infection in mice by affecting the viral replication machinery [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.027].
Overall, there is currently limited evidence that these nutraceuticals may affect COVID-19 infection as there is a significant lack of human studies.  

In contrast, there is evidence that nutrient supplements may exhibit some benefit against RNA viral infections. 
Zinc is a trace metal obtained from dietary sources or supplementation that is important for the maintenance of immune cells involved in adaptive and innate immunity [@doi:10.1016/j.abb.2016.03.022].
Indeed, adequate zinc intake has been associated with reduced incidence of infection [@doi:10.1093/ajcn/85.3.837] and antiviral immunity [@doi:10.1093/advances/nmz013].
Clinical trial data supports the utility of zinc to diminish the duration and severity of symptoms associated with common colds when it is provided within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms [@doi:10.1331/1544-3191.44.5.594.Hulisz; @doi:10.2174/1874306401105010051].
In coronaviruses specifically, in vitro evidence demonstrates that the combination of zinc (Zn2+) and zinc ionophores (pyrithione) can interrupt the replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-GFP and a variety of other RNA viruses [@doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176; @doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.015]. 
While overall there is encouraging data for zinc supplementation against the common cold, there is currently limited evidence to suggest zinc supplementation has any beneficial effects against the current novel COVID-19, thus further research is imperative.

Vitamins B, C, D, and E have also been suggested as potential nutrient supplement interventions for COVID-19 [@https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25707; @https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0347.v1].
Despite that it is well documented that regular vitamin C supplementation may reduce the duration of the common cold, vitamin C (> 200 mg) fails to reduce the incidence of  [@https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4.].
Vitamin C also reduces the susceptibility of patients to lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia [@https://doi.org/10.1097/00006454-199709000-00003].
A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated in twelve trials that vitamin C supplementation reduced the length of stay of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) by 7.8% (95% CI: 4.2% to 11.2%; p = 0.00003).
Furthermore, high doses (1-3 g/day) significantly reduced the length of an ICU stay by 8.6% in six trials (p = 0.003).
Vitamin C also shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation by 18.2% in three trials in which patients required intervention for over 24 hours (95% CI 7.7% to 27%; p = 0.001)  [@https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11040708]. 
Despite these findings, the CITRUS ALI study failed to show a benefit of a 96-hour infusion of vitamin C to treat ARDS, which is a severe complication of COVID-19 infection [@https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2019.11825].
There is anecdotal evidence from China and the United States that vitamin C is currently being used for the treatment of COVID-19, but further controlled research is required.    

In terms of other dietary supplements, vitamin D can modulate the adaptive and innate immune system.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility to infection [@https://doi.org/ 10.231/JIM.0b013e31821b8755].
A recent preprint postulated that an individual’s vitamin D status may significantly affect one’s risk of developing COVID-19. 
This hypothesis was derived from the fact that the current pandemic occurred in winter in Wuhan China when 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are at their lowest due to lack of sunlight, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, where it was nearing the end of the summer, the number of cases was low at that time coinciding with higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations  [@https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0235.v2].
However, this has yet to be determined as it is not yet even known whether COVID-19 is seasonal. 
Certainly, deficiency in vitamin D has been associated with a risk of ARDS and respiratory infection [@http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.11.017]. 
Therefore, the utility of supplementation and maintaining a healthy diet for optimum vitamin D status warrants further investigation. This is particularly important considering ‘stay in place’ guidance has been implemented in many densely populated cities around the world. 
This measure will limit people’s exposure to sunlight and thus reduce endogenous synthesis of vitamin D weakening the immune system and potentially increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. 

Despite all the potential benefits of nutraceutical and dietary supplement interventions presented, currently there is a paucity of clinical evidence to support their use for the prevention or mitigation of COVID-19 infections. 
However, optimal nutritional status will undoubtedly prime an individual’s immune system to protect against the effects of acute respiratory viral infections by supporting normal maintenance of the immune system (preprint without DOI: Calder, P.C.; Carr, A.C.; Gombart, A.F.; Eggersdorfer, M. Optimal Nutritional Status for a Well-Functioning Immune System is an Important Factor to Protect Against Viral Infections. Preprints 2020, 2020030199). 
Overall, supplementation of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may be an effective method of ensuring their adequate intake to maintain optimal immune function, which may also convey beneficial effects against viral infections due to their supposed antiviral effects.

### Biological Drugs for COVID-19

#### Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases. 
As a result, they have become one of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi: 10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. Ibalizumab for HIV and Palivizumab for RSV) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Although vaccines remain the most important way to treat viral infections, their development process is long and they fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
For that reason, neutralizing antibodies have emerged to address these shortcomings.
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This section discusses current efforts in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and how expertise gained from previous approaches for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may benefit antibody development.
