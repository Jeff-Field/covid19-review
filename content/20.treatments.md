## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individualâ€™s immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10/ggkd3b]. 
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.

##### Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) are quinolones that have been widely used as anti-malarial and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in humans.
HCQ and CQ act through the same mechanism of action, but HCQ has a better safety profile [@doi:10.1136/ard.2008.101766].
HCQ/CQ have been reported to have anti-viral effects, including in HIV-1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70361-9; @doi:10.1128/AAC.03011-14; @doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
In vitro studies of CQ use for SARs-CoV infection suggest anti-viral activity is due to inhibition of viral entry through elevation of endosomal pH and terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the cellular entry receptor [@doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-2-69].
In vitro studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection show both HCQ and CQ to be effective in inhibiting viral replication, with HCQ being more potent [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237].
Thus, there is excitement about HCQ as a potential therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
This section will discuss current efforts on assessing the potential role of HCQ in treating COVID-19.

###### Current Evidence

Gautret et al conducted a non-randomized, non-blinded, non-placebo clinical trial on 42 hospitalized patients comparing HCQ to standard care [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949].
This trial found patients who received HCQ showed higher rates of virological clearance by nasopharyngeal swab on Days 3-6 when compared to standard care.
This study also treated six patients with both HCQ + azithromycin and found this combination therapy to be more effective than HCQ alone.
This study showed design and analysis weaknesses that severely limit interpretability of results.
These weaknesses include: lack of randomization, lack of blinding, lack of placebo, lack of Intention-To-Treat analysis, lack of correction for sequential multiple comparisons, trial arms entirely confounded by hospital, false negatives in outcome measurements, lack of trial pre-registration, and small sample size.
Two of these issues are due to inappropriate data analysis and can therefore be corrected post-hoc by recalculating p-values (lack of Intention-To-Treat analysis and multiple comparisons.)
However, all other issues are fundamental design flaws and can not be corrected for.
Thus, conclusions cannot be generalized outside of the study.
Nevertheless, this study does provide promising preliminary data on the use of HCQ in COVID-19 treatment and supports further investigation of HCQ in large, rigorous clinical trials.

A randomized, non-placebo trial of 62 COVID-19 patients at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University studied whether HCQ decreased time to fever break or time to cough relief when compared to standard care [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758].
This trial found HCQ decreased both time to fever break and time to cough relief.
However, this study also showed design and analysis weaknesses that disallow general interpretation of results.
These weaknesses include: lack of placebo, inappropriate choice of outcomes, lack of correction for multiple primary outcomes, lack of sufficient detail to understand analysis, drastic disparities between pre-registration and published protocol, and small sample size.
It is important to note here that the authors claim "neither the research performers nor the patients were aware of the treatment assignments."
However, this seems impossible in a non-placebo trial - at the very least, providers would know whether they were giving HCQ or nothing, and this knowledge could lead to systematic differences in how care is given.
Correction for multiple primary outcomes can be adjusted post-hoc by recalculating p-values, but all other issues are design and statistical problems that cannot be corrected for.
Additionally, the issue of drastic disparities between pre-registration and published protocol may be suggestive of p-hacking.
Again, conclusions cannot de generalized outside of the study, but the results support further investigation.

A randomized trial from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center of 30 COVID-19 patients studied whether HCQ increased rates of virological clearance by respiratory pharyngeal swab on Day 7 post-treatment compared to standard care [how to cite? http://www.zjujournals.com/med/CN/10.3785/j.issn.1008-9292.2020.03.03].
This trial was published in Chinese with an abstract also in English.
Only the English abstract was read and interpreted.
The trial found HCQ showed comparable outcomes to standard care with regard to virological clearance rate, time to virological clearance, and time to body temperature normalization.
A known weakness is small sample size.
This problem suggests the study is underpowered to detect potentially useful differences and precludes interpretation of results.
Additionally, because only the abstract could be read, other design and analysis issues could be present.
Conclusions should be interpreted very cautiously.
However, these preliminary negative results do reiterate the need for further study.

A case study treated 11 consecutive patients with HCQ + azithromycin using the same dosing regime reported by Gautret et al [@doi:10.1016/j.medmal.2020.03.006].
One patient died, two were transferred to the ICU, and one developed a prolonged QT interval leading to discontinuation of HCQ + azithromycin.
As in the Gautret et al study, the outcome measurement was virological clearance at Day 6 post-treatment by nasopharyngeal swabs.
Of the ten living patients on Day 6, eight of the patients remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Interpretation of conclusions are severely limited by lack of comparison group and small sample size.
However, these results stand in contrast to claims by Gautret et al that all six patients treated with HCQ + azithromycin tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by Day 6 post-treatment.
This case study illustrates the need for better and further investigation.

A Letter to the Editor was published in BioScience Trends claiming numerous clinical trials showed HCQ is superior to control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of COVID-19 pneumonia [@doi:10.5582/bst.2020.01047].
This Letter has been cited by numerous primary literature, review articles, and media alike [@doi:10.7150/ijbs.45498; @doi:10.7150/ijbs.45053].
Yet, this Letter's claims of clinical trials supporting HCQ use refer only to 15 pre-registration identifiers from the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.
When these identifiers are followed back to the registry, most trials claim they are not yet recruiting patients or currently recruiting patients.
No trials data uploads or links to publications could be located on the pre-registrations.
At the very least, an inability to locate primary data means such claims cannot be verified.
Additionally, citation of unavailable sources cast doubt on policies and research based on the assumption that HCQ is effective in treating COVID-19.

###### Summary

In vitro evidence shows HCQ may be an effective therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. 
Multiple clinical studies have already been carried out to assess this possibility.
All current studies are low-quality and have small sample sizes.
Thus, interpretation is severely limited and must be done cautiously.
Additionally, disagreements between studies demonstrate there is controversy on the effectiveness of HCQ, as well as HCQ + azithromycin combination therapy.

This uncertainty is important to recognize clinically because HCQ-based treatments can lead to dangerous side effects like prolonged QT interval [@doi:10.1155/2016/4626279].
HCQ use for COVID-19 also leads to shortages for anti-malarial or anti-rheumatic use, where it has been definitively proven to be effective.
Further investigation of HCQ in large, rigorous, multi-center clinical trials is necessary.

#### Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases. 
As a result, they have become one of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi: 10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. Ibalizumab for HIV and Palivizumab for RSV) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Although vaccines remain the most important way to treat viral infections, their development process is long and they fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
For that reason, neutralizing antibodies have emerged to address these shortcomings.
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This section discusses current efforts in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and how expertise gained from previous approaches for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may benefit antibody development.
