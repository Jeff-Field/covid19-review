## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individualâ€™s immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10/ggkd3b]. 
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.

### Antiviral Approach: Remdesivir
Remdesivir (GS-5734) was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat of Ebola and was briefly tested in the clinic.  It does not have any FDA approved use.  There was some evidence of effectiveness, but it was not as effective as two antibody preparations so it was not pursued.

### Anticipated Mechanism
Remdesivir is metabolized to GS-441524, an adenosine analog that inhibits a broad range of polymerases and then evades exonuclease repair causing chain termination (https://www.jbc.org/content/early/2020/02/24/jbc.AC120.013056.abstract)(https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/2/e00221-18).   Although it was developed against Ebola, it also inhibits the MERS CoV and SARS CoV polymerase and inhibits corona virus replication in cell culture assays with submicromolar IC50s (https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/396/eaal36530.  It also inhibits CoV-19 showing synergy with chloroquine.
### Current Evidence
Remdesivir was used on four Covid-19 patients under compassionate use guidelines. All were in late stages of Covid-19 infection and the results have been mixed.  More recently Remdesivir entered controlled clinical trials.  As of March 2020, there are six clinical trials underway to treat Covid-19 patients at both early and late stages of infection and in combinations with other drugs (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0). (NCT04292730, NCT04292899, NCT04280705, 2020-000936-23, NCT04252664, NCT04257656). 
### Summary
Remdesivir is a major drug candidate since it attacks the virus with high potency and known mechanism.  Moreover, one of the most successful therapies for viral diseases is to target the viral replication machinery, which are typically virally encoded polymerases.  Small molecule drugs targeting viral polymerases are the backbones of treatments for other viral diseases including HIV and Herpes.  Note that the HIV and Herpes polymerases are a reverse transcriptase and a DNA polymerase respectively, whereas Covid-19 encodes an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, so most of the commonly used polymerase inhibitors are not likely to be active against Covid-19.    In clinical use, polymerase inhibitors show short term benefits for HIV patients but for long term benefits they must be part of combination regimens. They are typically combined with protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and even other polymerase inhibitors.   


### Vaccines

Vaccines, widely recognized as one of the most significant advances in human health during the 20th century, can be used to bolser both individual and herd immunity to a virus by promoting the development of antibodies without infection.
